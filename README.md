# PoolNVest
Pool money and Invest | An app for group investing with applications in financial literacy, mutual insurance, and personal investments

Our inspiration was to provide a robust and user-friendly financial platform. After hours of brainstorming, we decided to create a decentralized mutual fund on mobile devices. We also wanted to explore new technologies whilst creating a product that has several use cases of social impact. Our team used React Native and Smart Contracts along with Celo's SDK to discover BlockChain and the conglomerate use cases associated with these technologies. This includes group insurance, financial literacy, personal investment.

`celo` contains the Smart Contract for the entire application which dictates the transfer of funds. 
`Pool N Vest - Backend` contains the RESTful API with a robust authentication system based on MongoDB, NodeJS and Express
